# In exponential model, the correlation value is 0.843 and hence both variables are strong and positively correlated.
# Co-ef. are significant and co-ef.of Determination value. i.e R^2 is 0.71 which is good.
# Mean of errors is approx 0 and errors are normally distributed.
# Hence model is best fit and Sorting time is an appropriate input to determine delivery time.
